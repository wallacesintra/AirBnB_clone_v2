# Web Flask

## Web framework

A web framework is a software framework designed to aid in the development of web applications, websites, and web services. It provides a foundation for building, scaling, and maintaining applications by providing a structure that simplifies common tasks, enforces best practices, and abstracts complex low-level code.

### Features of web frameworks

1. Routing:  Defines how URLs correspond to application logic. It allows developers to map specific URLs to functions or controllers that handle requests.

2. Request Handling: Handles incoming HTTP requests from clients (browsers, mobile apps, etc.) and dispatches them to the appropriate parts of the application for processing.

3. Response Generation: Builds and sends HTTP responses back to clients, usually with dynamically generated content based on the request.

4. Template Engine: Provides tools for generating HTML or other markup to be sent back in responses, often using template files that mix static content with dynamic data.

5. Database Abstraction: Offers tools and patterns for interacting with databases, abstracting away low-level database operations and providing an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer for working with database entities.

6. Authentication and Authorization: Includes utilities for handling user authentication (login) and authorization (permissions and access control).

7. Middleware: Provides a way to modify incoming requests or outgoing responses globally across the application, allowing for tasks like logging, security checks, or request preprocessing.

8. Security Features: Offers built-in tools to mitigate common web security vulnerabilities such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and SQL injection.

9. Session Management: Manages user sessions and cookies, often integrating with authentication mechanisms.

10. Error Handling: Defines mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions that occur during request processing.
